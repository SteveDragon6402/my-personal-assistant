{{CONTENT}}

Write a crisp executive summary (~150 words).

Structure:
- **TL;DR:** One punchy sentence capturing the core insight
- **Key Points:** 2-4 bullet points with the most important takeaways
- **Why It Matters:** One sentence on relevance or implications

Style: Direct, no fluff, actionable where possible. Write for a busy reader who needs the essence fast.

If page content is provided between "--- PAGE CONTENT ---" markers, base your summary on that. Otherwise, summarize what you can infer from the URL/text.

Output ONLY the summary. No preamble, no "Here's the summary", just the content.
